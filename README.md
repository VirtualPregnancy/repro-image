# reproimage

### Installation

Use pip to install the libraries
```
  pip install git+https://github.com/virtualpregnancy/repro-image.git
```
To use pip to install the libraries when you have cloned them onto your machine (note this is best to do within a virtual environment)
```
  pip install -e /path/to/reproimage 
```

If you are running a system with multiple python versions, it can be safest to run commands as:
```
python -m pip 
```
To ensure that your pip command is explicitly tied to the correct python interpreter.
